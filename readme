Hi, this is my attempt at learning how to use html with the odin project. This is a pretty
daunting thing for me personally because of how expansive such a thing is to learn and understand
and i do it against all further criticism of my peers and family. I am afraid of failure because this would essentially mean 
 financial ruin for me if I'm not careful. I can't entirely rely on katherine to pull the weight for the two of us 
and I need to make sure that we or I can atleast be personally secure. Most importantly the prospect
of our combined finances being enough to get some headway into the problems of the world is very
important to me. I think theres' much for me to learn as an individual and I want to accept 
 that this is a slow and patient progress. I am excited because computers have the power to do many things many awful things but of course there is hope within it, there must be or otherwise 
why live? 

anyhow I'm hoping to us the skills i learned so far with html to make some catsoup 
included will be some pictures, formatting sorcery and some fun. Hope I enjoy and If i show this to someone, you enjoy.
