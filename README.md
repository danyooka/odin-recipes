# odin-recipes
hello this is a test 
my goal is to make sure i can make an interesting recipe for catsoup and test out all the web building i can do. 
i get pretty anxious about actually building and solving problems within my code but i think i need to just take it at a step at a time. I should probably read a mind for numbers to help me 
get through this challenge but i do think this will mean a lot. 
I will come back to reflect on the project at the end of this read me. I must also mk sure to do some git add and git commit
